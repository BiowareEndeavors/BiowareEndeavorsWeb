    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-01-19</p>

    <p>
      These Terms govern your use of Insight ("the Service").
      By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to them.
      If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. About Insight</h2>
    <p>
      Insight provides computational chemistry and simulation tools.
      We strive to deliver accurate, reliable, and high-quality results.
      However, due to the nature of numerical simulation and scientific modeling,
      we cannot guarantee results with 100% certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      You understand that outputs may vary based on input data, numerical methods,
      hardware, and software updates. Use results responsibly and verify independently
      where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Accounts & Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining account security.</li>
      <li>Do not share credentials or allow unauthorized access.</li>
      <li>Provide accurate and current information.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for activity under your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for illegal or harmful purposes.</li>

      <li>Abuse infrastructure or attempt denial-of-service attacks.</li>
      <li>Run automated workloads without permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Computational Results & Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Insight is designed to support research and experimentation.
      While we work hard to ensure correctness and stability, no simulation platform
      can guarantee perfect accuracy in all cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do not rely on Insight for medical, safety-critical,
      regulatory, or life-dependent decisions.
      You assume all responsibility for how results are used.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Privacy & Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      We respect your privacy and aim to minimize data collection.
      By using Insight, you acknowledge:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We store account information required to operate the service.</li>
      <li>Simulation inputs and outputs may be stored for debugging,
          performance optimization, and system improvement.</li>
      <li>We may use anonymized or aggregated data to train
          internal machine learning models and improve algorithms.</li>
      <li>We will never sell your personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Internal AI training uses anonymized data whenever possible.
      No personally identifiable information is intentionally used
      for training purposes.
